# Excel Project

## Tools

- Excel
- MySQL



## Data Cleaning / Preparation

1. Import csv data into excel.
2. Create a copy table of the existing table. This is the one we will work in and clean the data.  
3. Check for duplicates and remove them.
4. Check for NULL or BLANKS.
5. Remove columns that we do not need (Date, Day, Customer_Age, State, Sub_Category).
6. Delete previous and create new columns for profit, cost and revenue because they had mistakes (Cost = Unit_Price * Order_Quantity), Revenue = Unit_Price * Order_Quantity, Profit = Revenue - Cost).
